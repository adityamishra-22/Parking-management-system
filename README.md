## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
The application uses a custom CSS system built on top of Tailwind CSS:

```css
/* Custom CSS variables in src/App.css */
:root {
  --parking-primary: #10b981;
  --parking-secondary: #3b82f6;
  --parking-accent: #f59e0b;
  /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Configuration
Key configuration files:
- `src/entities/slot/types.js` - Slot and pricing configuration
- `src/shared/lib/storage.js` - Storage settings
- `src/App.css` - Styling and animation settings

### Adding New Features
1. Create feature directory in `src/features/`
2. Add business logic to appropriate entity in `src/entities/`
3. Update state management in `src/shared/lib/store.js`
4. Add routing in `src/app/routes/AppRouter.jsx`

## 🚀 Deployment

pnpm install
```

#### State Not Persisting
- Check browser localStorage availability
- Verify no browser extensions blocking localStorage
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`

#### Styling Issues
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check for CSS conflicts in browser dev tools
- Verify custom CSS variables are loaded
